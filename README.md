In the frame of BELSPO research project SR/10/202 “MS-SOC” we developed an empirical correction methodology for spectral Micasense Rededge imaging
to account for the effects of the bidirectional reflectance distribution function (BRDF), based on the calculation of an Anisotropy Factor (ANIF)
from drone-based hemispherical-directional reflectance measurements. The correction is meant to provide a spectral normalization of image reflectance
values based on nadir measurements. Images corrected with this methodology are less prone to cause spectral artifacts when used for orthomosaic
reconstructions with photogrammetric approaches.
The "Instructions.docx" guide is meant to show the step-by-step workflow to correct a set of Micasense Rededge images in the frame of a photogrammetric orthomosaic
reconstruction with the software Pix4D mapper.
